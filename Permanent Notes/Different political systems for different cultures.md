Perhaps different political systems do work better across different cultures. I think a world of clones of myself could make socialism work. But almost no one else could in the west. However most Japanese people I believe could do it too (cloned). So why not China? Economically however I think the capitalist system arguments have to be more efficient. If socialism could work really well in Japan, and maybe other Asian countries, maybe initially repulsive systems of government in the Middle East best represent the society at that point in time?
