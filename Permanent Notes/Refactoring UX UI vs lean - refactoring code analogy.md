Lean principles say to go as quickly as possible, and usually add in the one feature that provides most customer value at a time, so your startup can get to profitability as quickly as possible.

Perhaps a better strategy is to get all the core features, the 100% validated user desires, into a digital product very quickly with a really poor UX/UI. Then do a complete overhaul of the UX 'architecture' when all the unknowns are worked out, and all the features are there to link to one another. This may save time compared to constantly improving and perfecting a working polished product. 

### Code Analogy: 

When writing code, the need to refactor it comes as it grows larger. Some like to refactor as they go as quickly as possible, and others just 'get it working, then make it pretty'. Usually if there's something that you **know** is wrong and very easily fixable, you do it immediately while it's top of mind. Otherwise, if you make very large changes continuously to the architecture of your app, at the first hint that your current architecture will become unwieldy in the future, it's not clear you're be selecting the correct future architecture. If you wait for the codebase to settle a little before refactoring, this is typically more likely to not be redundant work.

### Network theory

If each feature is a node on a network graph, thereâ€™s something to be said for discovering all the nodes (roughly) so you can start connecting them and getting greater than the sum of the parts early on in UX/UI, rather than insertion sort and quadratically back-fixing features to accommodate the new one (minor tweaks to make it fit into the UX flow).
