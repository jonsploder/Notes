For example with Russia vs Ukraine media, this is a good principle for discounting clearly biased news:

|   | Western sources | Russian sources | 
|---|---|---|
| Pro western | Ignore | Listen to |
| Anti western | Listen to | Ignore |

Similarly with the Michelson-Morley experiment and various other experiments where those who organised it fully expected to find an Ether. In fact, afterwards, people came up with various explanations of ether drift which would account for their experimental results. But they were trustworthy because they were finding a result that they genuinely did not expect to find.

Similarly with current infantile sciences now, the only results that one should really listen to are ones that the authors find something that they didn't expect initially.

It's probably a good idea to go through the most publicly active scientists who rejected the climate change idea, and then see which of the arguments and results made them retract their opinion.

Confirming experiments aren’t useful. Most people confuse science with reason; if an argument has a flaw it’s wrong. If they can’t work out a flaw, they might concede it’s correct. This is insufficient. You need real evidence as well as reason (eg Parmenides and other philosophers who overemphasised reason). The problem is experimental evidence is trust based, so look for negative experimental evidence (to prove you wrong and prove the authors too)
