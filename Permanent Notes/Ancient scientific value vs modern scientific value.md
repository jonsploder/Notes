The problem with learning the history of science in along with modern science, is that modern science is most fruitful when looked at extremely skeptically because of the completeness of its explanatory power. Ancient ideas are better looked at trying to understand how powerful they must have initially been.

Modern science looks at negative cases more than positive cases
