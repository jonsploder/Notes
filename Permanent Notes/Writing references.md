Writing references cannot be academically taught or trained. Academics put in garbage references and try and search for quotes by famous people and papers to justify their erudition and intellect. Non-academic science authors put references in that readers actually want to follow up on in the chance they’re interested, not a form of flexing how intelligent one is. But the education system can’t teach this artificially, because it comes from empathy with readers for wanting to learn more, and genuine interest in the problem. A book written to help others like you, with similar passions as you. But academic writing is often for other reasons; pressure, reputation, etc. it’s not immediately obvious the difference between these references, and because teachers cannot question the passion of their students (they are trying to foster and develop this passion), then they can’t help but praise references because it seems like students are on the right track.
