Academically - fixed in a competitive curriculum - necessarily depth not breadth, also necessarily meeting what others deem to be true - you just get good at scoring points in exams or tests, not necessarily knowledge

Physically - trying too hard, also too narrow minded by setting goals and trying to accomplish them. Again, too much depth not enough breadth
