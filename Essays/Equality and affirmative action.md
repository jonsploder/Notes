There are three common definitions of equality:
- Equal application of rules and laws
- Equal opportunity
- Equal outcome

Each of these have their merits and demerits which are worth exploring, but some reflection on the power of circumstances is worth initial consideration.

When we are born, one could be born rich or poor, healthy or crippled, intelligent or stupid, fast or slow, beautiful or ugly, a great singer or of unpleasant voice. We do not chose our race, our parents or family, our neighbours, our State (initially at least), or the laws which we are coerced into obeying. Initially we have never had an opportunity to accept, propose or develop these laws, indeed one may be born into a tyrannical State.

During our lifetime, we might become seriously injured or lose our property due to natural calamities or human caused misfortunes. Perhaps we are involved in an earthquake, a flood, a burglary or become a victim of assault. Similarly we might profit from fortune - we might win the lottery, buy land, or marry into a wealthy family.

TODO: There are admittedly problems with the origin of who got the musical chairs at the start. Slavery, original property allocations etc. there are also problems with redistribution after the fact. List out all these issues. Is it because of the origin that we are outraged? What if the origin was bad luck? If through bad luck one has shit parents, should we take the children from their parents to equalise opportunity?
