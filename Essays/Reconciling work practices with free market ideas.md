There seems to be a tension between free market ideas and how companies operate in practice.
One might think that inside a company, it would be best practice to have a task list with a bounty system, in which any individual in the company could bid to do the work for a lower price. In this way people are incentivized to do work in proportion to their reward. 

Perhaps carving out this work and implementing the mechanics of the bounty system would be difficult, but it may be achievable.

There is another idea, which is that the company is really the epitome of a top down totalitarian structure. If the CEO or board wish to run a company in a very rigid system, they are allowed to do so. They're also allowed to have a libertarian-like flat structure instead. So what are the forces that lead companies to internally choose to have role-based work, where people are hired by the hour, to be on standby and rarely get rewarded for being a 10x employee?

The main reason is probably due to the desire for stability of the system - as soon as someone based a roles-based work structure, one erases key-man risk. No longer is the business at the mercy of the brilliance of individuals. The structure can be arranged in different ways to analyze and improve independent components, and be scaled up like a factory to eliminate bottlenecks.

Another force may certainly be the same force which propagates socialist politics in the real world - some people have the confidence and ego to believe that they can tell others how best to work, and wish for power.

## Mechanistic proposal

There must be some bidding system like an auction for work. Something must be done about the selection of tasks and overall direction of the work that is posted on the board, as well as prioritizing - some things must be done immediately, and therefore must be assigned a higher reward to attract more people to work on the problem. Who decides this priority, if not a top down authority?

Another issue is that people now have the incentive to do the most work, as quickly and poorly as possible, before moving on to another issue to claim the bounty. Some support duration, or delayed payment is probably a good idea, but another solution might be having custodian teams which accept the work before paying for it. In this way they're unlikely to accept bad work due to their necessity to support it. This support probably can't be done by a bounty system - perhaps a hybrid idea of some people always on the job is needed and they earn a base salary. An issue with this is that custodian teams almost never have an incentive to accept bounties to maintain, so perhaps their renumeration scales with the amount of work they approve.
