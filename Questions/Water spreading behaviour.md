Why does water, when it leaks out of a vertical straw onto the ground, not infinitely spread out on flat ground? Does it? Or does the weight of the edge of the puddle get offset by the pressure of air the puddle has displaced horizontally, pushing back against it?

if you have a straw full of water on a bench top and you lift it up, the water should go straight down, then as it collides with the bench top it should bounce straight back up and collide with the water above it coming down. This creates more pressure and somehow (how?) this Then makes the water at the base of the straw pool out perpendicularly to the force of gravity (straight down). The air it presses into is a fluid as well and so archimedes thought experiment applies to it as well(?)
